ascii-pacman.js
===============
A terrible example of variable naming. Poorly written, unfinished text version of pacman in javascript - see demo here: http://ddmills.com/pacman/

The movement is actually pretty slick though. Originally the movement was terrible, since you had to press wasd at the perfect time before you could turn down a corridor. Now you can press wasd before you get to the turn, and pacman will react accordingly.
